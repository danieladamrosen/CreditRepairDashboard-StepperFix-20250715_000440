## Changelog

- July 14, 2025: **✅ LAST NEGATIVE ACCOUNT CHOREOGRAPHY FINALIZED: 10-Step Comprehensive Sequence with Credit Accounts Auto-Collapse**
  - **Final Approved Choreography**: Implemented precise 10-step sequence for last negative account save with numbered emoji console logs
  - **Complete Sequence**: Save → Scroll to Credit Accounts → Pause 500ms → Collapse last account → Pause 500ms → Collapse all Negative Accounts → Pause 500ms → Collapse Credit Accounts (green) → Pause 500ms → Scroll to Public Records
  - **Smart Detection**: Only triggers when saving the last negative account (unsavedCount === 0), normal accounts use standard collapse + scroll behavior
  - **Collapsed Card Styling Fix**: Updated Negative Accounts collapsed saved state to use `px-4 py-3` padding and `border-[2px] border-green-500` for consistent height and green border matching other sections
  - **Credit Accounts Integration**: Added `onCreditAccountsCollapse` prop and `handleCreditAccountsCollapse` function to properly collapse and turn Credit Accounts green during choreography
  - **Console Logging**: Clear numbered emoji logs for each step: "1️⃣ Save → Account turns green immediately", "2️⃣ Immediately scroll to 20px above Credit Accounts section", etc.
  - **Files Modified**: client/src/components/credit-report/negative-accounts-section.tsx (choreography logic), client/src/pages/credit-report.tsx (handleCreditAccountsCollapse function and prop passing)

  - **Files Modified**: client/src/components/credit-report/hard-inquiries-section.tsx (collapsed section styling logic simplified to always show orange when not saved)

  - **Visual Hierarchy**: Collapsed state uses orange for user attention, expanded state uses neutral gray like Credit Accounts
  - **Files Modified**: client/src/components/credit-report/hard-inquiries-section.tsx (conditional styling logic for both collapsed and expanded CardHeader sections)
- July 14, 2025: **✅ RE-TRIGGER CHOREOGRAPHY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: Green Save Button Re-Activation Across All Components**
  - **Universal Re-Trigger Logic**: Implemented consistent re-trigger functionality across all save buttons in Credit Summary, Personal Information, Recent Inquiries, Older Inquiries, Account Row, and Public Records components
  - **Green Button Behavior**: Clicking green "Dispute Saved" buttons now resets state (false → true with 50ms delay) and re-triggers full choreography sequences
  - **Console Verification**: Added standardized console logging: "Save button clicked — triggering choreography regardless of isDisputeSaved" and "GREEN SAVE BUTTON CLICKED - Triggering re-save choreography"
  - **State Management**: All components use toggle pattern with setIsDisputeSaved(false) followed by setTimeout(() => setIsDisputeSaved(true), 50) to properly reset and re-trigger choreography
  - **Consistent Implementation**: Every save button now supports both initial save choreography and re-trigger choreography with identical behavior patterns
  - **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can now click any green save button to re-watch choreography sequences, providing better testing capability and user engagement

- July 14, 2025: **✅ PERSONAL INFORMATION CHOREOGRAPHY CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE: Eliminated Continuous Auto-Scroll Loops and Restored Manual Toggle**
  - **Root Cause Identified**: useEffect dependency array `[isDisputeSaved, isPersonalInfoChoreographyActive]` was causing continuous re-triggers after choreography completion
  - **Solution Applied**: Implemented `hasChoreographyRun` local flag with dependency array `[isDisputeSaved]` to prevent multiple choreography runs
  - **Fixed Choreography Logic**: Exact 5-step sequence now runs once per save: Step 1 (Mark Saved) → Step 2 (Scroll to Personal Info) → Step 3 (Collapse) → Step 4 (Scroll to Hard Inquiries) → Step 5 (Choreography Complete)
  - **Manual Toggle Restored**: Both CardHeader onClick and SavedCollapsedCard onExpand now properly check `!isPersonalInfoChoreographyActive` condition only
  - **Scroll Logic Cleanup**: Confirmed only personal-info.tsx contains scroll behavior (smoothScrollToSection helper function and 2 calls within choreography)
  - **Flag Reset Logic**: `hasChoreographyRun` resets to false when selections change (`setIsDisputeSaved(false)` triggers flag reset)
  - **Eliminated Auto-Scroll Loops**: Removed all scroll logic from inquiries-working.tsx, hard-inquiries-section.tsx, account-row.tsx, and public-record-row.tsx
  - **Files Modified**: client/src/components/credit-report/personal-info.tsx (choreography useEffect fix, hasChoreographyRun flag, flag reset logic)
- July 14, 2025: **✅ PERSONAL INFORMATION CHOREOGRAPHY FLOW PRECISION FIX COMPLETE: Exact 4-Step Sequence Implementation**

  - **Direct Scroll Implementation**: Created smoothScrollToSection helper function using direct element query and window.scrollTo with behavior: 'smooth'
  - **Removed hasPersonalInfoChoreographed**: Choreography now triggers every time user saves as required, not just once
  - **Simplified Re-save Logic**: Re-save button now resets isDisputeSaved state to trigger full choreography sequence
  - **Console Logging**: Added precise step-by-step logging: "Step 1: Personal Information Marked Saved", "Step 2: Scrolled to Personal Information", "Step 3: Personal Information Collapsed", "Step 4: Scrolled to Hard Inquiries", "Choreography Complete"
  - **CardHeader Protection**: Maintained isPersonalInfoChoreographyActive state check to prevent manual toggle during choreography
  - **Files Modified**: client/src/components/credit-report/personal-info.tsx (choreography useEffect, smoothScrollToSection helper, button click handler)
